# This is not the official code for the book

# Programming Phoenix Liveview code (B9)
* Updated for LiveView 0.18.16.
* Improved form components according to latest LV best practices and auto generated code.
* Fixed typos/syntax errors from the code presented in the book.
* Removed CSS from Chapter 8 (dashboard) since it ruins the Survey liveview.
* Contains some "Give it a Try" exercises (the ones I felt like doing).
* Code is fully functional except for Chapter 13, the game does not work :grimacing:.
